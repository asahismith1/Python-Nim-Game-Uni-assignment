# Python-Nim-Game-Uni-assignment
Nim game made in Python for Year 1 Semester 1 University assignment. Score: 20/20.

Start by entering your name, then the game will start. It will randomly choose who starts (you or CPU). A board of four rows of sticks will be displayed, this is the game board.
When it's your turn, you will be asked which row to take sticks from, and how many.

The aim of the game is to NOT be the one to take the final stick, (i.e. leave just one stick for the opponent to take).

Good luck.
